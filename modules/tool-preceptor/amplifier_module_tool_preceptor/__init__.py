# SUBJECT AUTHORITY -- UNCONDITIONALLY AVAILABLE ON EVERY INSTANCE.
#
# `forget` deletes a user's own observation records because they asked. What
# authorizes it is that the records are ABOUT THEM; no measurement, no
# credential, and no operator decision is involved. So it is gated by nothing:
# not `writable`, not `surface`, not any future config key.
#
# That is a correction of a correction, and both errors are worth recording
# because they were the SAME error. `forget` first sat in _WRITE_OPERATIONS
# behind `writable: true` -- held only by credentialer, so the deletion right
# was unreachable from every shipped session. The first fix moved it behind a
# NEW key, `surface: "consent"`, which fixed the two adoption bundles and left
# the full loop (bundle.md -> behaviors/preceptor.yaml, which sets no surface)
# still unable to reach it -- while shipping context/awareness.md's promise of
# `preceptor forget --since <date>` in that very session. A config knob whose
# value decides whether a person may delete their own data is the wrong shape
# no matter what it is called, and it fails silently by omission: a
# composition that simply does not set the key loses the right with no error,
# which docs/CONSENT.md already says is worse than having no control at all.
#
# There is no composition where "you may be recorded but may not delete" is
# the right answer. If the bundle records, deletion must work. If it does not
# record, `forget` is harmless -- there is nothing to delete. Hence
# unconditional BY CONSTRUCTION, so no composition can lose it by omission.
